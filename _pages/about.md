My research interests include security and privacy in biometrics and machine learning.

I received my BS. degree (honors program) from [VNUHCM - University of Science](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), Vietnam, in 2013 and my Ph.D. degree from [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/) in alliance with [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), Japan, in 2022.
