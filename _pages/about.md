I am Huy H. Nguyen (Nguyễn Hồng Huy in Vietnamese).

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan. 
My research interests include security and privacy in biometrics and machine learning.

I received my BS. degree (honors program) from [VNUHCM - University of Science](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), Vietnam, in 2013, and my Ph.D. degree from [The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/) in alliance with the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), Japan, in 2022. For more details, please take a look at my CV [here](https://github.com/honghuy127/honghuy127.github.io/blob/master/files/CV.pdf).
